# Ability Components

I am implementing a rudimentary system of Ability Components. For now that does not include material components, but that is likely to change.

### List of Ability Component Types:

* *Verbal*: The spell or ability requires that the caster say something, and can be hindered by the *Silence* status effect.

* *Manipular*: The spell or ability requires that the caster use their hands to make gestures or manipulate a component. The *Stunned* status effect can hinder this component.

(**more to come**)
